Time Spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
- currentTimeMillis() method returns the current time in milliseconds.
- The unit of time of the return value is a milisecond.
- The granularity of the value depends on the underlying operating system and may be larger.
- Many operating systems measure time in units of tens of miliseconds.
- BinSearch() uses "unchecked" operations which cause warnings if not suppressed.
- LinSearch() was more efficient/faster for smaller array searches, while BinSearch() was more efficient/faster for larger array searches.

QCC:
- What causes the significant variability in the length of time taken by a function to run an array?
- What other factors could contribute to longer run time (individual computers, etc.)?
- Are there any other search methods that could be tested along with binary search and linear search? Are there any search methods that are more efficient than binary search?
