Time Spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
- currentTimeMillis() method returns the current time in milliseconds.
- The unit of time of the return value is a milisecond.
- The granularity of the value depends on the underlying operating system and may be larger.
- Many operating systems measure time in units of tens of miliseconds.
- BinSearch() uses "unchecked" operations which cause warnings if not suppressed.
- LinSearch() was more efficient/faster for smaller array searches, while BinSearch() was more efficient/faster for larger array searches.
- When given the worst case for a target, Binary Search is more efficient with arrays of larger length.
- When given the best case for a target, Linear Search is slightly more efficient than Binary Search overall.

QCC:
- What causes the significant variability in the length of time taken by a function to run an array?
- What other factors could contribute to longer run time (individual computers, etc.)?
- Are there any other search methods that could be tested along with binary search and linear search? Are there any search methods that are more efficient than binary search?

GALLERY TOUR:
- Team Consonants
	- BinSearch faster, difference more dramatic for larger arrays.
	- Used a different number of searches for each size.
	- The size of the number and time did not increase proportionally to each other.
	- Targets are chosen randomly.
	- The largest number took 2 hours for LinSearch.
	- Searched every element in the array.
- Team Walrus
	- Made 2 augmented search methods, where you can input the array and the number of trials.
	- It retuns the number of times the array is accessed.
	- Only used 1,000,000 elements as a test case in the array.
- Team DiscordDucks
	- Had 7 arrays of ascending order.
	- Each array had 100 random numbers.
	- The largest array consisted of 50 million elements.
	- Tested 100 trials for each search method.
- Team MumbleCore
	- Tested arrays of different sizes, each for 10,000 trials.
	- Had a consistent procedure.
	- Tested only the worst case for each search method.
- Team Silly Serpents
	- Each array gives updates for the program status, prints every operation when it is done.
	- Compares random best and worst cases.
