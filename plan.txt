- Method doTrials takes a Comparable[] a, and an int numTrials
  - initializes long initTime that stores the current time
  - has a while loop that runs BinSearch with a and a random integer numTrials times
  - initializes another long midTime to store the time after finished, and before LinSearch starts
  - has a while loop that runs LinSearch with a and a random integer numTrials times
  - another long finalTime will store the final time
- Method findTime (takes time in seconds)
  - initializes double binTime as (double)(midTime - initTime)/1000
  - double linTime is (double)(finalTime - midTime)/1000
- Method compareTime 
  - checks if binTime > linTime or binTime < linTime, in which case it prints the number of trials and by how many seconds faster
  - if they are equal, prints the corresponding message
