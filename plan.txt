- Method doTimeTrials takes a Comparable[] a, and an int numTrials
  - sets long initTime that stores the current time
  - has a while loop that runs BinSearch with a and a random integer numTrials times
  - sets another long midTime to store the time after finished, and before LinSearch starts
  - has a while loop that runs LinSearch with a and a random integer numTrials times
  - another long finalTime will store the final time
- Method findTime (takes time in seconds)
  - sets double binTime as (double)(midTime - initTime)/1000
  - double linTime is (double)(finalTime - midTime)/1000
- Method compareTime
  - runs doTimeTrials and findTime 
  - checks if binTime > linTime or binTime < linTime, in which case it prints the number of trials and by how many seconds faster
  - if they are equal, prints the corresponding message

(possible alternative test, modifies BinSearch and LinSearch to count the number of tries it takes to reach the target)
- Method doNumTrials takes Comparable[] a, and int numTrials
  - has a while loop that runs BinSearch numTrials times, and records the total number of tries to hit the target
  - while loop runs LinSearch numTrials times, and records
- Method compareTrials
  - runs doNumTrials
  - prints the corresponding message for whichever was more efficient
